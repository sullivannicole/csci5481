# Homework 3

The main objective of this homework was to implement the Nei-Saitou neighbor joining algorithm for ["creation of phylogenetic trees"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_joining).

## Getting started

The main program is contained in `neighbor_joining.py`. Dependencies are given at the top of the script. The shell command to run the program is `python neighbor_joining "inputs/filename.fna"`. Two actual inputs are available in the `inputs` folder: `example.fna` is a small file of 7 short sequences. `hw3.fna` contains the full set of sequences used in this homework.

## Homework instructions and helper scripts
The original instructions for the homework are included in a pdf file called `ancillary/hw3_instructions.pdf`. Additionally, the helper scripts provided as a part of the homework (for visualizing the outputs from the neighbor joining program) are also saved in the `ancillary` folder.

## Deliverables
This homework was submitted via gradescope; therefore, the main deliverable beyond the code in this folder was the `hw3_written.pdf` document, also saved in the `ancillary` folder. Visualizations created using the helper scripts are embedded in this document.
